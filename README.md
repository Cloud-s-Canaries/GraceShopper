# MEME-AZON

### https://meme-azon.herokuapp.com/

MEMAZON is a mock e-commerce site designed to sell fun and useful memes. Users can create account and browse through products. They can add and delete products to their cart. The cart persists in the database for authenticated users and in the browser's local storage for guest users. If a guest adds product to their cart and then sign-in to an account the products will still be in the cart. Administrator can add, edit, delete products. Also, the Admin can delete the user.
